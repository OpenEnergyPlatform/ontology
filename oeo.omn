Biofuels can be derived directly from plants (i.e. energy crops), or indirectly from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes.[1] Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis. Other renewable biofuels are made through the use or conversion of biomass (referring to recently living organisms, most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy-containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid, liquid, or gas form. This new biomass can also be used directly for biofuels.",

It is sometimes spelled kerosine in scientific and industrial usage.

Kerosene is widely used to power jet engines of aircraft (jet fuel) and some rocket engines and is also commonly used as a cooking and lighting fuel and for fire toys such as poi. In parts of Asia, kerosene is sometimes used as fuel for small outboard motors or even motorcycles.",

A varying current in one coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a voltage in a second coil. Transformers are used to increase or decrease the alternating voltages in electric power applications.
2. A transformer is a static machine used for transforming power from one circuit to another without changing frequency. This is a very basic definition of transformer. Since there is no rotating or moving part so transformer is a static device. Transformer operates on ac supply. Transformer works on the principle of mutual induction.

        <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115> "The concept of \"energy balance\" is an accounting framework for the compilation and understanding of data on all energy products entering, exiting and being used in a country. The energy balance is the most complete statistical accounting of energy products and their flow in the economy. Columns of the energy balance represent energy products (fuels). Rows represent energy flows.

The energy balance expresses all forms of energy in a common accounting unit. The balance shows the relationships between supply, inputs to the energy transformation processes and their outputs as well as the actual energy consumption by different sectors of end-use.",

In der horizontalen Gliederung (Spalten) werden die EnergietrÃ¤ger ausgewiesen, die der energetischen und nichtenergetischen Nutzung dienen. In der vertikalen Gliederung (Zeilen) werden fÃ¼r die jeweiligen EnergietrÃ¤ger Aufkommen, Umwandlung und Verwendung erfasst.

Als EnergietrÃ¤ger werden alle Quellen oder Stoffe bezeichnet, in denen Energie mechanisch, thermisch, chemisch oder physikalisch gespeichert ist. FÃ¼nf Kerngruppe werden bei der Energiebilanz unterschieden:

    Fossile Brennstoffe
    Erneuerbare Energien
    Strom
    Kernbrennstoffe
    FernwÃ¤rme

Bilanzebenen
Schematische Darstellung des Bilanzraums der deutschen Arbeitsgemeinschaft Energiebilanzen
PrimÃ¤r- und Endenergie sowie Umwandlungsverluste

Die Abgrenzung erfolgt in drei Bilanzbereichen:

    die PrimÃ¤renergiebilanz,
    die Umwandlungsbilanz und
    der Endenergieverbrauch.

In der PrimÃ¤renergiebilanz werden die EnergietrÃ¤ger mit ihrem Mengenaufkommen bei der Gewinnung und Anlieferung nach folgenden Kriterien erfasst:

    inlÃ¤ndische Gewinnung von EnergietrÃ¤gern,
    AuÃenhandel mit EnergietrÃ¤gern, unterteilt nach Einfuhr und Ausfuhr,
    Hochseebunkerungen (HeizÃ¶l, Dieselkraftstoff und Schmierstoffe fÃ¼r die nationale und internationale Seeschifffahrt in deutschen HÃ¤fen. Ohne Lieferungen an Binnen- und KÃ¼stenmotorschiffe und Fischerei, die zum Sektor Verkehr (Endenergieverbrauch) zÃ¤hlen.)

Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion. Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of elements in the actinide series of the periodic table. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators. The possibility of generating electricity from nuclear fusion is still at a research phase with no commercial applications. This article mostly deals with nuclear fission power for electricity generation."@en,
