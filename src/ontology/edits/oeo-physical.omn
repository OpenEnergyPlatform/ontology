    dc:description "The Open Energy Ontology is an ontology for all aspects of the energy modelling domain. The 'Physical' module covers all those aspects of the world that are relevant for the energy systems domain, including physical entities such as generators, power lines, technologies, portions of matter; attributes of those, such as the energy they carry or release, whether they can be a pollutant, or their origins; representational transformations into maps and measures, such as coordinates, units, quantities; and the processes that modify the physical entities, such as energy production.",

It includes gas produced by carbonisation (including gas produced by coke ovens and transferred to gasworks gas), by total gasification with or without enrichment with oil products (LPG, residual fuel oil, etc.), and by reforming and simple mixing of gases and/or air, reported under the rows ‘from other sources’. Under the transformation sector identify amounts of gasworks gas transferred to blended natural gas which will be distributed and consumed through the natural gas grid.

The production of other coal gases (i.e. coke oven gas, blast furnace gas and oxygen steel furnace gas) should be reported in the columns concerning such gases, and not as production of gasworks gas. The coal gases transferred to gasworks plants should then be reported (in their own column) in the transformation sector in the gasworks plants row. The total amount of gasworks gas resulting from transfers of other coal gases should appear in the production line for gasworks gas."@en,
