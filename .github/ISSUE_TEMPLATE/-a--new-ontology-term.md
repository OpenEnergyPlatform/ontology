## Description of the issue

Here describe the issue as extensively as possible

## Ideas of solution

If you already have ideas for the solution describe them here

## Workflow checklist

- [ ] I discussed the issue with someone else than me before working on a solution
- [ ] I already read the **latest** version of the [workflow](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTE.md) for this repository
- [ ] I added this issue to the Project 'Issues'. If suitable, I add it to further Projects. 
- [ ] The [goal](https://github.com/OpenEnergyPlatform/ontology/blob/dev/README.md) of this ontology is clear to me 

I am aware that
- [ ] every new entry in the ontology should have an annotation
- [ ] classes should arise from concepts rather than from words
- [ ] class or property names should follow the [UpperCamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)
