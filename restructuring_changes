Most classes werent in their right BFO category and BFOs principle of the asserted monohierarchy was (and is) violated.
So I moved the classes to their right categories and then started to work on the inconsistencies.
Most classes were just moved to "independant continuant/ material entity/ object" as they were material objects.
A detailed description of the changes for consistency reasons is below, sorted by commit:

Commit: First restructuring
	- Moved classes
	- Added object properties: depends_on,  g_depends_on and s_depends_on
	- Added superclass to ModelComponent: "part_of some model"
	- Added superclass to ElectricityGridComponent: "part_of some ElectricityGrid"
	- Added ElectricityProductionUnit to ElectricityGridComponent
	- Removed ElectricityProductionUnit and StorageUnit from MaStR subclasses, but in what relationship do they stand?

Commit: Removed inconsistencies
	- Removed superclass Transformer from Subgrid
	- Removed disjoint with ElectricityGrid from Subgrid
	- Removed uses_dataset some MaStR from WindTurbine bc WindTurbine is an Object and not a Transformation and the range of uses_dataset is transformation
	- Removed has_input some Sea from WindOffshore bc WindOffShore is a geographicRegion and not an InformationArtefact and the range of has_input is InformationArtefact

Commit: restructured subclasses of WindEntity
	- The subclasses of WindEntity are: Requierements, ManufacturerSpecifications, TechnicalDataWind, Technology (with semanticweb IRI)
	- Created new class WindEntityData as subclass of InformationArtifact
	- Changed subclasses of WindEntity to subclasses of the new class WindEntityData instead, as they are Data and not objects (wind turbines)
	- Added superclass "has_part some WindEntityData" to WindEntity
	- Deleted the Technology Class with the IRI http://www.semanticweb.org/izzet_kilicarslan/ontologies/2019/9/untitled-ontology-10#Technology in favor of the other Technology Class (with the normal oeo IRI) to prevent confusion bc of two "Technology" classes
	- Changed IRIs of the former subclasses of WindEntity from "http://www.semanticweb.org/izzet_kilicarslan/ontologies/2019/9/untitled-ontology-10" to  "http://openenergy-platform.org/ontology/oeo/" to conform to the ontology
